Version History:

0.1.2 - 07/16/2014 - jfrancis - Setting the carrier was broken.  The
code was comparing the current carrier with what the carrier was
previously set to, and only pushing the change if they differed.  This
means that if the user clicked the carrier to a new spot, or of AFC
caused it to drift, updating the carrier had no effect.  Changed to
code to compare the desired carrier with the actual carrier, and make
the change based on that, rather than the value it was previously set
to.

0.1.1 - 07/09/2014 - jfrancis - Crap, I committed the cardinal
developer's sin.  I made a change to the code and did a commit without
testing it first.  After all, what could go wrong?  Radio gear was
still packed from a camping trip, and didn't feel like hooking it up
just to test.  Got a little overzealous with the to_i vs. to_f and
tried to send FLDigi a frequency as an int instead of a float.  Hope
there's not more.  This should be a hint to me that it's time to add
some automated regression testing.  It's on the list...

0.1.0 - 07/02/2014 - jfrancis - Finally added everything on github.
No real code changes.  Finally ready for people to start using for
something useful.

0.0.15 - 07/02/2014 - jfrancis - Oops. No changes, just messed up
the metadata.

0.0.14 - 07/02/2014 - jfrancis - Be more consistent about to_f vs.
to_i.  Also, add a function to return actual radio freq (instead of
specified freq).

0.0.13 - 06/11/2014 - jfrancis - A bunch of clean-up here.  I almost
certainly broke some code with this one.  I changed @freq to
@dial_freq to more accurately reflect what's going on, and added a
method self.freq() to get/set the actual transmit frequency.
Anything that did fldigi.freq=1234567 before will need to change to
fldigi.dial_freq=1234567.  My apologies, but it just needed to be
done.

0.0.12 - 06/05/2014 - jfrancis - Allows for additional data to be
appended to the output queue during transmit.  Also now defaults to
not displaying a running output of transmitted data (though it can
be switched back on with a 'true' flag to send_buffer()).

0.0.11 - 05/29/2014 - jfrancis - Added optional offset.

0.0.10 - 05/26/2014 - jfrancis - Forgot the 'require'.

0.0.9 - 05/26/2014 - jfrancis - Added a lot of code comments.

0.0.8 - 05/26/2014 - jfrancis - Fixed 10m propnet frequency. Got
carried away with 0.0.7 fix, and had one too many zeros in there.

0.0.7 - 05/26/2014 - jfrancis - All propnet frequencies were low by
an order of magnitude (ie, left off a zero).

0.0.6 - 05/25/2014 - jfrancis - First public release on
rubygems.org.
