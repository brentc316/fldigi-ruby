    <p>This code is still very much in the initial "figuring things
      out" stage, so my apologies in advance, but things are going to
      break from time to time.  For example, I just changed freq.
      freq used to be an instance variable that indicated (or set) the
      dial frequency.  I changed freq to dial_freq to be more
      accurate, and added the method freq() to get/set the actual
      transmit/receive frequency (ie, dial freqency plus carrier).  If
      you wrote some code using the old library, I just broke it.  But
      in the long term, it's better that way.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, here are links to the goodies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/fldigi">Here</a> is where
	you can get the gem.  Or just do <i>sudo gem install
	fldigi</i> from the command line.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jfrancis42/fldigi-ruby">This</a>
	is the full github repository, including the example/demo
	code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Best of luck, 73.</p>
